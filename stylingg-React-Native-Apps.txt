"Styling React Native Apps"
#There is No CSS!
(Inline Styles) <===> (StyleSheet Objects)

#Write in JavaScript
(i.e. in JavaScript code files, next to the component code)
Based on CSS syntax, but only a "subset" of properties & features is supported!

#Styling
(To style in react-native you must pass in the style prop into the component itsel)
The style prop is not supported by all the elements
--Supported Elements
  1. <View></View>
  2. <Text></Text>

  #Layouts & Flexbox
  flex: 1, => The element (container) should expand to occupy available space.

  flexDirection: "column", => controls the oriantation of "Main Axis" and "Cross Axis"

  justifyContetnt: "flex-start",
  alignItems: "flex-start"

  <Button/> doesnt have a "style" element

  In react native the styling of the parent element doesnt carry on to the child.

  <ScrollView> renders all the items which could be aproblem if you have a long list which could cause performing issues

  <FlatList> should be used when you are doing a long list because it lazy loads the items as the user gets closer to it. When using <FlatList> you don't need to map through items you can pass in the data element to it and make it equal to the array that you want to map through. Then using the "renderItem" you create a arrow function and return what you need. When using <FlatList> to get unique items you can pass the "keyExtractor" element to it
  keyExtractor = {(item, index) => {
    return item.id
  }}
