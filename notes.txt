"Working With Core Components"

1. "Core" Components -> (Built into React Native)
-"Translation" to Native UI widgets is provided by React Native
  1 <View/>
  2 <Text/>
  3 <Button/>
  4 <TextInput/>
  5 <Image/>
  6 <... />
2. Your UI & CUSTOM Components
-Combination of "Core" components & other built-in components.

<View/><Text/> =>
Const MyTitle = props => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{props.title}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}


<View></View> works just like a <Div></Div>

#Basic Components
<View> => The most fundamental component for building a UI.
<Text> => A compont for displaying text
<Image> => A component for displaying images
<TextInput> => A component for inputting text into the app via a keyboard
<ScrollView> => Provides a scrolling container that can host multiple components and views
<StyleSheet> => Provides an abstraction layer similar to CSS stylesheets
(With React-Native you must import the components from the "react-native library")
